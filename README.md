# Squirrel Object Detection Dataset
It's exactly what it says! There may be more than one dataset in this repo, and I'm
not sure which one is the best/actually properly labeled (This project was done 
before "good file organization" was a part of my skillset). All images are hand-labeled,
and only pictures of live, brown squirrels are included. I'm not sure the exact species,
but these are squirrels that are typically found in the San Francisco bay area.
